shortdesc: the biggest disaster in our lifefimte
---

on january 28 1986, around noon, i was walking through the cafeteria at my high school in fall river massachusetts.  it was lunchtime.  i can remember the linoleum floor.  the tables were filled with my classmates, the smell of french fries wafted from the kitchen.  it was a tuesday, so later that evening the cafeteria would be filled with local residence for bingo.  i was near the double doors leading to the classroom halls.  on the right was dean of students, brother moran's office, next to that the attendance secretary's office.  there was tv in the corner, rarely on, it was now showing live coverage of the generational disaster space shuttle challenger exploding 73 second after take off.  i was stunned.

this event is like many other generational disasters; hiroshima, jfk's assassination, 911, or covid lockdown.

these events are painful and draw us together at the same time.  these events are significant not just because they changed the course of modern world history, but also often come with a single photographic event or specific distinct media image that burns into our memory.  we can likely recall colors, smells, feelings so specific on events like these because they affected us in deep and meaningful ways and come with iconic imagery; a mushroom cloud, a slow moving convertible limo, a low flying sideways turned plane heading into the middle of a building, an awkwardly worn mask. 

there are other events that are more disastrous, but occur over weeks, months or years and therefore they do not have the same feeling, the same memory; they are blurred.  these events we tend to forget more easily.  there isn't a pulitzer prize winning photo of the event.  these are slow moving, some might say tiny changes, leading to the disaster that we only see in hindsight. these events are more dangerous, more impactful.  

i would argue that that the single largest disaster of our generation (perhaps of the last 50 or 75 years) is the 2008 housing crisis. people lost jobs, homes, lives.  people saw their property worth nothing.  people saw their retirement accounts shrink to tiny values of what they were only a short time before.  scarcely a person on the planet was left untouched.  this event is so large and so impactful, and moved at such an odd pace, that it is a struggle to know exactly when the _event_ began.  was it when when countrywide (in california) collapsed?  was it when lehman brothers collapsed?  in that event, over $13 trillion in wealth was lost. economically we would take 10 years to recover.

the trigger for the housing crisis was quite simply greed.  well, greed and a lack of controls to help regulate bad actors. in the wake of the crisis, congress in its wisdom, enacted the dodd-frank act.  the dodd-frank act implemented numerous things, including the establishment of the consumer financial protection bureau; a federal independent agency established to help prevent a future disaster like the 2008 housing crisis. it is an action taken to help prevent future disasters.  creating the cfpb is a good idea. 

it is a good idea like it is a good idea to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. it is a good idea like not letting the president ride in an open air-car, at 11 miles an hour.  it is a good idea like preventing the space shuttle from taking off in freezing temperatures.  it is a good idea like not allowing airplane passengers to carry certain items.  it is a good idea like simply wearing a mask to prevent infectious disease.

it's a good idea to help prevent a future collapse of the modern economy.  it's a good idea to help have guardrails around systems so large, that if they failed, they would have catastrophic effects on every person on earth.  cfpb was established to help ensure that large banks are profitable, provide financial service and do it in a way as to not harm consumers.  cfpb is a good idea.

i am an alum of cfpb.  i worked there for 4 years with perhaps the most talented, smart, dedicated group of people i will ever have the pleasure of working with. i worked there leading a team who implemented an information system about every home mortgage application annually.  this data can be instrumental in ascertaining if banks are discriminating against anyone or trying to keep some people down.  this data is so steeped in history, that too many volumes of books and articles and fair practice research and indeed laws have been written to mention here; safe for it to say that this data, home mortgage disclosure act data, is as important as the us census.  

i think this data has a separate intrinsic value outside the use case of discrimination.  this data can be shown to be an early warning signal for financial collapse.  i spoke about this potential [at GovSummit 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gav9iyvVgiA) and wrote about it briefly [here](https://feomike.github.io/post/tip-of-the-iceberg.html).  this data can show, simply trends.  trends are needed to see slow tiny changes.  they show difference across years, decades, epochs, rather than the single pulitzer photo.  in hindsight, home mortgage disclosure data shows that we knew the 2008 crisis was coming, but did too little too late, and it devastated the world economy.

recent events scare me more than that morning in 2009 in our suburban home in sacramento california when my wife and i realized that more than half of the houses on our street were for sale, because they were underwater.  more than when we realized later in 2009 that our house was worth about half of what we bought it for in 2004.  more than in 2010, when we made painful decision to leave california with our 3 young children, and move across country on a maxed out credit card, leaving our house to barely sell for what we bought 6 years earlier.  

the recent events to attempt to shut down the cfpb, scare the living hell out of me. i am not scared for me, personally.  my wife and children are healthy.  i am not likely to face any discrimination.  i am financially secure. i am frightened for the worldwide financial meltdown that will potentially come in 4-6 years if the attempts to remove the cfpb are successful.  if cfpb is successfully removed, then there won't be any guardrails on the large financial institutions, or worse yet, tech oligarchy getting into financial services on a grand scale, lacking regulation, and taking mass advantage of consumers.  

without the cfpb, there will not be an iconic disastrous moment.  it will be far worse.  not only will you not see it coming, no one else will either.  no trend datasets on the united states housing market.  no team of research economists whose job it is to study trends to help prevent financial meltdowns.  no technologist whose job it is to write code and store databases of banking lending trends on their eminent collapse.  no dedicated regulatory teams which argue for months on how best to protect your privacy.  

attempting to close the cfpb is one of many tiny changes.  it is hardly noticeable by many.  it is a slow-moving disaster.  there is no iconic photo.  there is no grainy video.  in the moment, there won't be a specific idea burned into memory.  in fact, most people will blame either the new president, or worse poor people or immigrants.

i encourage all to take some action.  to write your senators.  to call your congressional representatives.  to inform your governors, your state districts attorneys.  to use your voice, to demonstrate how important this institution is.  cfpb is a good idea.  closing it is a disaster waiting to happen.
