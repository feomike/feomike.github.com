            <h2>FAA Airport Closures</h2>
            <p>On Friday, March 22, 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration released this <a href="http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=14414">press release</a> describing a "decision that 149 federal contract towers will close beginning April 7 as part of the agencyâ€™s sequestration implementation plan."</p>

<p>In addition to the release was a <a href="http://www.faa.gov/news/media/fct_closed.pdf">document</a> listing the individual name, city, state and airport identification signs of those towers to be closed.</p>

<p>Working on a previous <a href="http://feomike.github.com/posts/2013/state_seq">conclusion</a> that perhaps PDFs are not a great way to release data, and that indeed information like this is a) easy to produce and b) very cheap to publish and host as rich interactive content, I took the short time to open this data and make it releasable.  Below is the dynamic map which is the result.</p>

<h2>How I Did It</h2>

<p>I first copied the data from the pdf above, into this <a href="../../data/faa_closed_20130322.csv">text</a>.  This 'data file' is essentially one row per newly proposed closed airport by the FAA.  I saved that document to an excel file, and uploaded that file to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aooxb2GcQ9ifdDRWOVBLUU1ocHRuNFRSUjNwVUZjYmc&amp;usp=sharing">this google document sheet</a>.  I edited the columns slightly, to concatenate the columns (see column F) into a more readible place name; one that was more likely to be found by a geocoder.  I then used <a href="http://mapbox.com/blog/mapping-google-doc-spreadsheet/">this process</a> to associate each row (e.g. airport) with its latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>The same <a href="http://mapbox.com/blog/mapping-google-doc-spreadsheet/">tool</a> described above, contains a way to export this newly geocoded file to a geoJson file.  I performed that export, which is <a href="../../data/FAA_closed_20130322.geojson">this file</a>.</p>

<p>I then used <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> to create a simple map of these locations.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, this process was essentally free and took little time to produce.</p>

<h4>Data</h4>

<p>The new data files can be found below and so can a brief description of how I did this.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The process is simple repeatable, but more importantly, the impact of the news item is much more clearly represented.  In my (our) previous experiment, independent <a href="http://chelm.github.com/state_seq/examples/states.html">new applications</a> sprung up.  I expect the same might be true here.</p>
