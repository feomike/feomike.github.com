                Recently at the FCC, we held an unusual day.  We call it D(f)evEx (pronounced as either devex or fedex) Days, and this was our first ever.  The idea stems from fedEx, where something needs to be delivered (as in 'to production') in 24 hours; combined with a developer day. We took the opportunity to take a time out for our day to day grind, and promise to each other that we would produce working product in the next 24 hours; in essence a focused day of learning new skills, or honing existing ones, NOT part of our regular duties.

                Working on a previous conclusion that perhaps PDFs are not a great way to release data, and that indeed information like this is a) easy to produce and b) very cheap to publish and host as rich interactive content, I took the short time to open this data and make it releasable.  Below is the dynamic map which is the result.

                On Sunday, February 25, 2013, the White House released documents detailing the projected costs to states of the upcoming sequester. Several news outlets carried the story, however, only the Huffington Post had links to each individual state document.
